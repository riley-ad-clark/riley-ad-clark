## About 🖥️🥁 
Hello! My name is Riley Clark. I am an aspiring software developer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

I am currently studying software development at the Manitoba Institude of Trades and Technology (MITT), specializing in full-stack development.
I enjoy my work as a student creating websites that are not only beautiful, but fully functional as well! In my spare time, I enjoy gaming, playing the drums,
and listening to any, and all music.

Currently, my programming experience consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown. By the end of my course, I plan to have learned C#, React, and many others!
I am also well versed in both the Microsoft, and Adobe suite.

Feel free to check out some of my work! | <a style="color:#2aa889" href="https://www.rileyclark.dev" target="_blank">rileyclark.dev</a>
